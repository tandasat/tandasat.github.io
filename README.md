## About the Trainer

Satoshi is a system software engineer and security researcher with over 15+ years of experience. He works on virtualization for game console and previously worked as a developer, researcher, and reverse engineer at security software vendors.

He enjoys developing and reverse-engineering system software and teaching low-level technologies. His strong interest in platform security led him to study virtualization technologies and write research hypervisors since early 2009 (there was even no EPT at the time!). He open-sources [hypervisors](https://github.com/tandasat/MiniVisorPkg) [for](https://github.com/tandasat/SimpleSvm) [researchers](https://github.com/tandasat/HyperPlatform), details [applications](https://github.com/tandasat/Hypervisor-101-in-Rust) and [progression](https://github.com/tandasat/Hello-VT-rp) of virtualization technologies, and discovers [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/tandasat/CVE-2024-21305) [in hypervisors](https://github.com/tandasat/CVE-2023-36427) and [other](https://github.com/tandasat/SmmExploit) privileged software. He has taught the class for over a hundred professionals online as well as at reputable security conferences such as [OffensiveCon](https://www.offensivecon.org/), [Recon](https://recon.cx/), and [Hexacon](https://www.hexacon.fr/).
